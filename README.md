## Summary

The program solves the issue of unorganized task distribution between teams and departments in small and medium-sized enterprises, which leads to task conflicts and project delays. It provides an integrated system for coordination and continuous communication between teams to ensure efficient project execution without conflicts.

## Background

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) often struggle with effective task distribution, project coordination, and communication between teams. These challenges can lead to task conflicts, delays, and reduced productivity. Unlike larger corporations, SMEs frequently lack access to advanced management tools, which puts them at a disadvantage when trying to optimize their processes. Many businesses face these issues, resulting in misaligned goals and inefficiencies that affect overall performance.

The problem is particularly common in organizations with multiple departments, where tasks may overlap or conflict, and the lack of a clear communication system further complicates matters. Despite the availability of tools for larger enterprises, few solutions exist that are tailored to the specific needs and budget constraints of SMEs. This makes it difficult for smaller businesses to adopt the best practices in project management.

From a personal perspective, having worked in project management, I’ve seen firsthand how disorganization and lack of clear reporting can cause projects to stall or fail. My experience has driven me to find a solution that simplifies business management processes for SMEs. This issue is not only relevant but also crucial, as improving management practices in SMEs can lead to higher productivity, better use of resources, and faster growth. By solving these problems, the “Business AI Manager” project can provide SMEs with the tools they need to thrive in today’s competitive market, enhancing their chances for long-term success.

The key issues that the program will solve are:
* The Problem: SMEs face challenges in organizing work across different teams, such as task conflicts between department heads and delays in delivering progress reports. These issues lead to decreased productivity and increased errors.
* Problem Prevalence: Many SMEs struggle with effective task management and project coordination, often lacking the advanced tools available to larger companies.
* Personal Motivation: Based on my experience in project management, I have observed how poor coordination between teams and the lack of continuous reporting negatively impact workflow. I aim to provide a solution to these issues by automating administrative processes.
* Importance of the Topic: Improving business management in SMEs can significantly boost their productivity and efficiency, leading to the growth of these enterprises and increasing their chances of success.

## How is it used?

Users: The system is designed for department heads and executives in SMEs. They can use it to organize tasks, track progress, and receive detailed reports.
Affected Individuals: Executives and team members from various departments will be the direct beneficiaries, while customers will benefit from improved company efficiency and faster project delivery.

## Challenges

What the Project Doesn’t Solve: The project cannot address human resource issues like training or employee motivation. It also relies on the accuracy of input data, meaning it may face challenges if the data is incomplete or inaccurate.
	•	Limitations: Although the system provides recommendations based on historical success data, applying these suggestions might not always be successful due to the unique nature of different companies and industries.

## What next?

Future Growth: The project could expand to include deeper market analysis and competitor data. It could also be extended to larger companies or multinational corporations. Furthermore, it could integrate with human resource management systems and inventory management to improve coordination across the company as a whole.
